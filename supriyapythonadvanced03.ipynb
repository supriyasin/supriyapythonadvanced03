    "\n",
    "\"\"\"Introduction:-\n",
    "   We will continue our discussion of inheritance features by examing abstract classes. Once again, in many ways \n",
    "   abstract classes are a simple concept (involving only one new keyword that can be used in two places) that has \n",
    "   deep ramifications when designing complex class hierarchies. We will discuss this Java language feature in the \n",
    "   context of the Positional Shape Inheritance Demo, which you should download, run, and examine. In this lecture \n",
    "   we will compare abstract classes to interfaces (which seem closely related: for example we can extend interfaces \n",
    "   via inheritance too) and see multiple ways to accomplish approximate the same result -and compare them. Finally, \n",
    "   we will examine some general principles for designing classes in inheritance hierarchies.. \n",
    "   \n",
    "   Defining Abstract Methods and Classes:-\n",
    "   Sometimes a class should define a method that logically belongs in the class, but that class cannot specify \n",
    "   how to implement the method. For example, the Shape class is used as a superclass for 2-dimensional shapes \n",
    "   (like circles, rectangles, etc). Logically, every shape should have a getArea method, because every shape has \n",
    "   an area. But, every shape would compute its area using a different formula, and there is no way to specify one \n",
    "   getArea method in the Shape class that is correct for all its possible subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "   In an application, we might want to declare a Shape array, fill it with references to objects constructed from \n",
    "   actual shapes (subclasses of Shape), and then ask each shape to return its area. We would like Java to call the \n",
    "   correct getShape method for each object to compute the result correctly; again, this illustrate how Java implements \n",
    "   polymorphism to solve such a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "   We accomplish this in Java by defining the getArea method in the Shape class, but by specfying the abstract keyword \n",
    "   in its list of access modifiers (as a syntax constraint this keyword can be used when defining only classes and methods) \n",
    "   and then specifying no implementation (no method body, just like in an interface). We would specify it in the Shape \n",
    "   class as follows:\n",
    "   \n",
    "     public abstract double getArea();\n",
    "\n",
    "  By defining this method, we are telling the Java compiler that it should allows us to call the getArea method \n",
    "  using any variable declared with the type Shape, or declared with any class that is a subclass of Shape \n",
    "  (where the definition of getArea will really appear). For example, we can define the toString method in the Shape class as\n",
    "\n",
    "  public String toString( )\n",
    "  {return \"Shape[id=\"+id+\",area=\"+getArea()+\"]\";}\n",
    "\n",
    "  This method calls getArea and returns (as a String) the area of the shape. Our first big rule about using abstract \n",
    "  concerns where abstract methods can be called.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  1.Any method in a class can be declared abstract. Such a method has no body ({...} is replaced by just ;, as in \n",
    "  interfaces) and can be called in other methods defined in that class, or be called in methods defined in any of \n",
    "  its subclasses, or be called using any variables whose type is this class or any of its subclasses. \n",
    "\n",
    "  Our second big rule about using abstract concerns the relationship between abstract method and the classes in which\n",
    "  the are defined. \n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  2.If a class defines any abstract methods (or, as we will see, inherits any abstract methods and doesn't override them), \n",
    "  that class must be defined using the abstract keyword in its access modifiers. \n",
    "\n",
    "  If this second rule is violated, the Java compiler will detect and report an error, so if we forget to make a \n",
    "  class abstract, Java will just remind us with no harm caused..\n",
    "\n",
    "  In fact, we will define the Shape class (using an id instance variable and constructor) throughout the examples in \n",
    "  this lecture as\n",
    "  \n",
    "  public abstract class Shape {\n",
    "\n",
    "    public Shape (String id)\n",
    "    {this.id = id;}\n",
    "\n",
    "    //This abstract method must be defined in a concrete subclass.\n",
    "    //Note that it is called in this class in the toString method.\n",
    "    public abstract double getArea();\n",
    "\n",
    "    public String getId()\n",
    "    {return id;}\n",
    "    \n",
    "    public String toString( )\n",
    "    {return \"Shape[id=\"+id+\",area=\"+getArea()+\"]\";}\n",
    "\n",
    "    private String id;\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Generally, abstract classes can specify all the standard class components: constructors, methods, and instance variables. \n",
    "  Again, a class must be defined with the keyword abstract (as is the case above) if any of its methods is defined with the \n",
    "  keyword abstract (as is the case above). Note that we can call the abstract method in other methods defined in the class, \n",
    "  even if its body isn't defined yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Again, logically this method belongs in the class, even if it cannot be written there (because Shape is too high in the \n",
    "  hierarchy).\"\"\"\n",

    "#2. What happens when a class statement's top level contains a basic assignment statement?\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"We use Python assignment statements to assign objects to names. The target of an assignment statement is written \n",
    "   on the left side of the equal sign (=), and the object on the right can be an arbitrary expression that computes an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "  There are some important properties of assignment in Python :-\n",
    "\n",
    "    . Assignment creates object references instead of copying the objects.\n",
    "    . Python creates a variable name the first time when they are assigned a value.\n",
    "    . Names must be assigned before being referenced.\n",
    "    . There are some operations that perform assignments implicitly.\n",
    "    \n",
    "  Assignment statement forms :-\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Basic form:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  This form is the most common form.\n",
    "\n",
    "  student = 'Geeks'\n",
    "  print(student)\n",
    "\n",
    "  OUTPUT:\n",
    "  Geeks\n",
    "\n",
    "  2. Tuple assignment:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  # equivalent to: (x, y) = (50, 100)\n",
    "  x, y = 50, 100  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  print('x = ', x)\n",
    "  print('y = ', y)\n",
    "\n",
    "  OUTPUT\n",
    "\n",
    "  x = 50 \n",
    "  y = 100\n",
    "  \n",
    "  When we code a tuple on the left side of the =, Python pairs objects on the right side with targets on the left \n",
    "  by position and assigns them from left to right. Therefore, the values of x and y are 50 and 100 respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "  3. List assignment:\n",
    "\n",
    "  This works in the same way as the tuple assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "  [x, y] = [2, 4]\n",
    "  \n",
    "  print('x = ', x)\n",
    "  print('y = ', y)\n",
    "\n",
    "  OUTPUT:\n",
    "\n",
    "  x = 2\n",
    "  y = 4\n",
    "  \n",
    "  4. Sequence assignment:\n",
    "\n",
    "  In recent version of Python, tuple and list assignment have been generalized into instances of what we now call \n",
    "  sequence assignment – any sequence of names can be assigned to any sequence of values, and Python assigns the items \n",
    "  one at a time by position.\n",
    "\n",
    "  a, b, c = 'HEY'\n",

    "\n",
    "  a = H\n",
    "  b = E\n",
    "  c = Y\n",
    "\n",
    "  5. Extended Sequence unpacking:\n",
    "\n",
    "  It allows us to be more flexible in how we select portions of a sequence to assign.\n",
    "\n",
    "  p, *q = 'Hello'\n",
    "  \n",
    "  print('p = ', p)\n",
    "  print('q = ', q)\n",
    "  \n",
    " Here, p is matched with the first character in the string on the right and q with the rest. The starred name (*q) \n",
    " is assigned a list, which collects all items in the sequence not assigned to other names.\n",
    "\n",
    "  OUTPUT:\n",
    "\n",
    "  p = H\n",
    "  q = ['e', 'l', 'l', 'o']\n",
    "\n",
    "  This is especially handy for a common coding pattern such as splitting a sequence and accessing its front and rest part.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ranks = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']\n",
    "  first, *rest = ranks\n",
    "  \n",
    "  print(\"Winner: \", first)\n",

    "  6. Multiple- target assignment:\n",
    "\n",
    "  x = y = 75\n",
    "  \n",
    "  print(x, y)\n",
    "\n",

    "  \n",
    "  # equivalent to: x = x + 1\n",

    "Before heading into multiple inheritance, let’s take a quick detour into the mechanics of super().\n",
    "\n",
    "While the examples above (and below) call super() without any parameters, super() can also take two parameters: the \n",
    "first is the subclass, and the second parameter is an object that is an instance of that subclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let’s see two examples showing what manipulating the first variable can do, using the classes already shown:\n",

    "        super(Square, self).__init__(length, length)\n",
    "\n",
    "  In Python 3, the super(Square, self) call is equivalent to the parameterless super() call. The first parameter \n",
    "  refers to the subclass Square, while the second parameter refers to a Square object which, in this case, is self. \n",
    "  You can call super() with other classes as well:\n",
    "\n",

    "    def surface_area(self):\n",

    "#4. How can you augment, instead of completely replacing, an inherited method?\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"Each method that is inherited from a superclass can be augmented to perform some different action in the new class. \n",
    "   If there is no augmentation then the inherited methods will perform as defined in the superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "  An inherited method is augmented simply by creating a new definition for the method in your class definition. \n",
    "  The following example demonstrates augmenting an inherited method:\n",

    "Class cMessageButton1 is a Button\n",
    "\n",
    "    Procedure DoShowSomething\n",

    "  In this example, the first class cMessageButton1 defines a new method DoShowSomething that displays the message \n",

    "  cMessageButton2 inherits DoShowSomething and OnClick from cMessageButton1, but it augments DoShowSomething to display \n",
    "  a different message. An object of this class, when clicked would show the message \"Second Message.\"\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Message Forwarding\n",
    "\n",
    "  A more sophisticated way to augment an inherited method involves forwarding. Message forwarding allows you to augment \n",
    "  an inherited method in such a way that it can perform its inherited action and some new action.\n",
    "\n",
    "  All three method types can be forwarded (Procedure, Procedure Set and Function). Messages are forwarded by executing \n",

    "Forwarding Function Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Forward Get {method-name} {Param1 … ParamN} To {receiving-variable}\n",
    "\n",
    "  You can see that the syntax for forwarding a message is the same as the syntax for executing a method except that the \n",
    "  Forward command is appended to the front of each statement. There is also no object reference when forwarding a method. \n",
    "  You are always forwarding the message to the superclass of the current object.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of method augmentation with message forwarding follows:\n",
    "\n",
