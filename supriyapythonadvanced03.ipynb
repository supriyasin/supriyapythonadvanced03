    "\n",
    "\"\"\"Introduction:-\n",
    "   We will continue our discussion of inheritance features by examing abstract classes. Once again, in many ways \n",
    "   abstract classes are a simple concept (involving only one new keyword that can be used in two places) that has \n",
    "   deep ramifications when designing complex class hierarchies. We will discuss this Java language feature in the \n",
    "   context of the Positional Shape Inheritance Demo, which you should download, run, and examine. In this lecture \n",
    "   we will compare abstract classes to interfaces (which seem closely related: for example we can extend interfaces \n",
    "   via inheritance too) and see multiple ways to accomplish approximate the same result -and compare them. Finally, \n",
    "   we will examine some general principles for designing classes in inheritance hierarchies.. \n",
    "   \n",
    "   Defining Abstract Methods and Classes:-\n",
    "   Sometimes a class should define a method that logically belongs in the class, but that class cannot specify \n",
    "   how to implement the method. For example, the Shape class is used as a superclass for 2-dimensional shapes \n",
    "   (like circles, rectangles, etc). Logically, every shape should have a getArea method, because every shape has \n",
    "   an area. But, every shape would compute its area using a different formula, and there is no way to specify one \n",
    "   getArea method in the Shape class that is correct for all its possible subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "   In an application, we might want to declare a Shape array, fill it with references to objects constructed from \n",
    "   actual shapes (subclasses of Shape), and then ask each shape to return its area. We would like Java to call the \n",
    "   correct getShape method for each object to compute the result correctly; again, this illustrate how Java implements \n",
    "   polymorphism to solve such a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "   We accomplish this in Java by defining the getArea method in the Shape class, but by specfying the abstract keyword \n",
    "   in its list of access modifiers (as a syntax constraint this keyword can be used when defining only classes and methods) \n",
    "   and then specifying no implementation (no method body, just like in an interface). We would specify it in the Shape \n",
    "   class as follows:\n",
    "   \n",
    "     public abstract double getArea();\n",
    "\n",
    "  By defining this method, we are telling the Java compiler that it should allows us to call the getArea method \n",
    "  using any variable declared with the type Shape, or declared with any class that is a subclass of Shape \n",
    "  (where the definition of getArea will really appear). For example, we can define the toString method in the Shape class as\n",
    "\n",
    "  public String toString( )\n",
    "  {return \"Shape[id=\"+id+\",area=\"+getArea()+\"]\";}\n",
    "\n",
    "  This method calls getArea and returns (as a String) the area of the shape. Our first big rule about using abstract \n",
    "  concerns where abstract methods can be called.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  1.Any method in a class can be declared abstract. Such a method has no body ({...} is replaced by just ;, as in \n",
    "  interfaces) and can be called in other methods defined in that class, or be called in methods defined in any of \n",
    "  its subclasses, or be called using any variables whose type is this class or any of its subclasses. \n",
    "\n",
    "  Our second big rule about using abstract concerns the relationship between abstract method and the classes in which\n",
    "  the are defined. \n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  2.If a class defines any abstract methods (or, as we will see, inherits any abstract methods and doesn't override them), \n",
    "  that class must be defined using the abstract keyword in its access modifiers. \n",
    "\n",
    "  If this second rule is violated, the Java compiler will detect and report an error, so if we forget to make a \n",
    "  class abstract, Java will just remind us with no harm caused..\n",
    "\n",
    "  In fact, we will define the Shape class (using an id instance variable and constructor) throughout the examples in \n",
    "  this lecture as\n",
    "  \n",
    "  public abstract class Shape {\n",
    "\n",
    "    public Shape (String id)\n",
    "    {this.id = id;}\n",
    "\n",
    "    //This abstract method must be defined in a concrete subclass.\n",
    "    //Note that it is called in this class in the toString method.\n",
    "    public abstract double getArea();\n",
    "\n",
    "    public String getId()\n",
    "    {return id;}\n",
    "    \n",
    "    public String toString( )\n",
    "    {return \"Shape[id=\"+id+\",area=\"+getArea()+\"]\";}\n",
    "\n",
    "    private String id;\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Generally, abstract classes can specify all the standard class components: constructors, methods, and instance variables. \n",
    "  Again, a class must be defined with the keyword abstract (as is the case above) if any of its methods is defined with the \n",
    "  keyword abstract (as is the case above). Note that we can call the abstract method in other methods defined in the class, \n",
    "  even if its body isn't defined yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Again, logically this method belongs in the class, even if it cannot be written there (because Shape is too high in the \n",
    "  hierarchy).\"\"\"\n",

    "#2. What happens when a class statement's top level contains a basic assignment statement?\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"We use Python assignment statements to assign objects to names. The target of an assignment statement is written \n",
    "   on the left side of the equal sign (=), and the object on the right can be an arbitrary expression that computes an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "  There are some important properties of assignment in Python :-\n",
    "\n",
    "    . Assignment creates object references instead of copying the objects.\n",
    "    . Python creates a variable name the first time when they are assigned a value.\n",
    "    . Names must be assigned before being referenced.\n",
    "    . There are some operations that perform assignments implicitly.\n",
    "    \n",
    "  Assignment statement forms :-\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Basic form:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  This form is the most common form.\n",
    "\n",
    "  student = 'Geeks'\n",
    "  print(student)\n",
    "\n",
    "  OUTPUT:\n",
    "  Geeks\n",
    "\n",
    "  2. Tuple assignment:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  # equivalent to: (x, y) = (50, 100)\n",
    "  x, y = 50, 100  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  print('x = ', x)\n",
    "  print('y = ', y)\n",
    "\n",
    "  OUTPUT\n",
    "\n",
    "  x = 50 \n",
    "  y = 100\n",
    "  \n",
    "  When we code a tuple on the left side of the =, Python pairs objects on the right side with targets on the left \n",
    "  by position and assigns them from left to right. Therefore, the values of x and y are 50 and 100 respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "  3. List assignment:\n",
    "\n",
    "  This works in the same way as the tuple assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "  [x, y] = [2, 4]\n",
    "  \n",
    "  print('x = ', x)\n",
    "  print('y = ', y)\n",
    "\n",
    "  OUTPUT:\n",
    "\n",
    "  x = 2\n",
    "  y = 4\n",
    "  \n",
    "  4. Sequence assignment:\n",
    "\n",
    "  In recent version of Python, tuple and list assignment have been generalized into instances of what we now call \n",
    "  sequence assignment â€“ any sequence of names can be assigned to any sequence of values, and Python assigns the items \n",
    "  one at a time by position.\n",
    "\n",
    "  a, b, c = 'HEY'\n",

    "\n",
    "  a = H\n",
    "  b = E\n",
    "  c = Y\n",
    "\n",
    "  5. Extended Sequence unpacking:\n",
    "\n",
    "  It allows us to be more flexible in how we select portions of a sequence to assign.\n",
    "\n",
    "  p, *q = 'Hello'\n",
    "  \n",
    "  print('p = ', p)\n",
    "  print('q = ', q)\n",
    "  \n",
    " Here, p is matched with the first character in the string on the right and q with the rest. The starred name (*q) \n",
    " is assigned a list, which collects all items in the sequence not assigned to other names.\n",
    "\n",
    "  OUTPUT:\n",
    "\n",
    "  p = H\n",
    "  q = ['e', 'l', 'l', 'o']\n",
    "\n",
    "  This is especially handy for a common coding pattern such as splitting a sequence and accessing its front and rest part.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ranks = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']\n",
    "  first, *rest = ranks\n",
    "  \n",
    "  print(\"Winner: \", first)\n",

    "  6. Multiple- target assignment:\n",
    "\n",
    "  x = y = 75\n",
    "  \n",
    "  print(x, y)\n",
    "\n",
    "  In this form, Python assigns a reference to the same object (the object which is rightmost) to all the target on the left.\n",

    "  \n",
    "  # equivalent to: x = x + 1\n",

    "  A super() Deep Dive\n",

    "While the examples above (and below) call super() without any parameters, super() can also take two parameters: the \n",
    "first is the subclass, and the second parameter is an object that is an instance of that subclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, letâ€™s see two examples showing what manipulating the first variable can do, using the classes already shown:\n",

    "  In Python 3, the super(Square, self) call is equivalent to the parameterless super() call. The first parameter \n",
    "  refers to the subclass Square, while the second parameter refers to a Square object which, in this case, is self. \n",
    "  You can call super() with other classes as well:\n",
    "\n",
    "class Cube(Square):\n",
    "    def surface_area(self):\n",

    "#4. How can you augment, instead of completely replacing, an inherited method?\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"Each method that is inherited from a superclass can be augmented to perform some different action in the new class. \n",
    "   If there is no augmentation then the inherited methods will perform as defined in the superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "  An inherited method is augmented simply by creating a new definition for the method in your class definition. \n",

    "Class cMessageButton1 is a Button\n",
    "\n",
    "    Procedure DoShowSomething\n",

    "  In this example, the first class cMessageButton1 defines a new method DoShowSomething that displays the message \n",

    "  cMessageButton2 inherits DoShowSomething and OnClick from cMessageButton1, but it augments DoShowSomething to display \n",
    "  a different message. An object of this class, when clicked would show the message \"Second Message.\"\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Message Forwarding\n",
    "\n",
    "  A more sophisticated way to augment an inherited method involves forwarding. Message forwarding allows you to augment \n",
    "  an inherited method in such a way that it can perform its inherited action and some new action.\n",
    "\n",
    "  All three method types can be forwarded (Procedure, Procedure Set and Function). Messages are forwarded by executing \n",
    "  a Forward statement. The syntax for forwarding a message is different for each type of method as outlined below:\n",

    "Forwarding Function Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Forward Get {method-name} {Param1 â€¦ ParamN} To {receiving-variable}\n",
    "\n",
    "  You can see that the syntax for forwarding a message is the same as the syntax for executing a method except that the \n",
    "  Forward command is appended to the front of each statement. There is also no object reference when forwarding a method. \n",
    "  You are always forwarding the message to the superclass of the current object.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of method augmentation with message forwarding follows:\n",
    "\n",
